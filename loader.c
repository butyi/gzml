//Erase and flash write subroutines to be downloaded into RAM and call them by monitor RUN command.
//See "loader" folder. 
//  Compile: asm8 loader.asm. 
//  Call "php s19tocarray.php loader/loader.s19". 
//    This script re-format data from S19 to C array.
//    Example: S123010055C2A6FFF755C0A606F755C2F655C4F7AE02AD2355C0A60EF7A604AEC8AD184B23
//    Drop out S record identifier (S1), length (23), address (0100) from start of line, and checksum (23) from end of line.
//    Result: 55C2A6FFF755C0A606F755C2F655C4F7AE02AD2355C0A60EF7A604AEC8AD184B
//    Split to bytes.
//    Result: 55 C2 A6 FF F7 55 C0 A6 06 F7 55 C2 F6 55 C4 F7 AE 02 AD 23 55 C0 A6 0E F7 A6 04 AE C8 AD 18 4B
//    Put "0x" before every byte, and separate by coma. 
//    Result: 0x55,0xC2,0xA6,0xFF,0xF7,0x55,0xC0,0xA6,0x06,0xF7,0x55,0xC2,0xF6,0x55,0xC4,0xF7,0xAE,0x02,0xAD,0x23,0x55,0xC0,0xA6,0x0E,0xF7,0xA6,0x04,0xAE,0xC8,0xAD,0x18,0x4B,
